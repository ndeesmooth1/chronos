This is a working prototype of an electron tray app called Chronos,
currently tested on Mac OS, should also work for Windows.

It allows for adding tasks to a list and then setting timer for 
them that works in the system tray.

Please keep in mind that tasks saved on the hard drive in a 
ChronosApp/data.json file.

Many features still under development but skeleton should work
already.



### Getting started

`yarn`

Start dev server:

`yarn start`

In a new terminal window:
